<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Throughout my career journey, I have gained valuable experience in <br/>
    both technical and customer service roles. Originally from the Philippines,<br />
    I began my professional career as a computer salesman and technician,<br />
    honing my skills in hardware and software troubleshooting, as well as <br />
    providing exceptional customer support.</p>
    
    <p>Seeking new opportunities and growth, I made the bold decision to <br />
    relocate to the United Kingdom. Since then, I have been dedicatedly <br />
    working as an office and customer service assistant, where I have <br />
    further expanded my skill set. In this role, I have had the privilege <br />
    to utilize Kofax third-party software for efficiently indexing digital <br />
    documents, enhancing workflow processes and ensuring <br />
    seamless organization of important information.</p>
    
    <p>Driven by my passion for continuous learning and my aspiration to stay <br />
    up-to-date with the rapidly evolving technology landscape, I recently <br />
    completed a Level 3 certification course in cybersecurity. This course <br />
    not only provided me with a strong foundation in ensuring the security <br />
    and integrity of digital systems and networks but also instilled in me a <br />
    profoundunderstanding of the importance of data protection and <br />
    risk management.</p>

    <p>I am currently taking a web development course that covers HTML, <br/>
    CSS, and JavaScript. Through this training, I have gained a strong <br/>
    understanding of these foundational languages and developed a passion <br/>
    for web development. I am detail-oriented, skilled in problem-solving, <br/>
    and strive to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. <br/>
    My goal is to secure a position or (apprenticeships) in IT industry where <br/>
    I can contribute my expertise and collaborate with a dynamic team. <br/>
    I am confident in my abilities and eager to translate my education <br/>
    into practical solutions for real-world challenges.</p>
